# [rock-paper-scissor game]

**Project Goals:**

* Build a classic Rock Paper Scissors game with JavaScript.

* Practice core programming concepts with a simple but engaging project.

* Implement a user interface for player input (buttons or a text prompt).


What I Learned:

* Conditional Logic: Constructing the game logic using if, else, and comparison operators to determine the winner of each round.
  
* Functions: Encapsulating the game rules within functions for reusability and modularity.
  
* Randomization: Generating random choices for the computer opponent using Math.random.
  
*  User Input: Handling player input through buttons or a prompt-based text interface.
 
* DOM Manipulation (optional): Updating scores and messages on the webpage dynamically, providing a visual experience.

Feel free to:

* Explore the code to understand the fundamental JavaScript concepts behind this game.
